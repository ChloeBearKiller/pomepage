<h1 style="text- aling: center;"> A blessing </h1>
<h2  style="text- aling: center;"> By Abram Joseph Ryan </h2>
<p style="color: #6A869E;" Be you near, or be you far,<br>
    Let my blessing, like a star,<br>
     Shine upon you everywhere!<br>
    And in each lone evening hour,<br>
    When the twilight folds the flower, <br>
     I will fold thy name in prayer.  </p>
<p style="color: #6A869E;" In the dark and in the day,<br>
    To my heart you know the way,<br>
     Sorrow's pale hand keeps the key;<br>
    In your sorrow or your sin<br>
    You may always enter in;<br>
     I will keep a place for thee. </p>
	 <p style="color: #6A869E;" If God's blessing pass away <br>
    From your spirit; if you stray <br>
     From his presence, do not wait.<br>
    Come to my heart, for I keep<br>
    For the hearts that wail and weep,<br>
     Ever opened wide -- a gate.<br>
 </p>
 
 <p style="color: #6A869E;"  In your joys to others go, <br>
    When your feet walk ways of woe<br>
     Only then come back to me;<br>
    I will give you tear for tear,<br>
    And our tears shall more endear<br>
     Thee to me and me to thee.<br>
</P> 
<p style="color: #6A869E;" For I make my heart the home<br>
    Of all hearts in grief that come<br>
     Seeking refuge and a rest.<br>
    Do not fear me, for you know,<br>
    Be your footsteps e'er so low,<br>
     I know yours, of all, the best.<br>
 </P>
 <p style="color: #6A869E;" Once you came; and you brought sin;<br>
    Did not my hand lead you in --<br>
     Into God's heart, thro' my own?<br>
    Did not my voice speak a word<br>
    You, for years, had never heard --<br>
     Mystic word in Mercy's tone?<br>
 </p>
 <p style="color: #6A869E;" And a grace fell on your brow,<br>
    And I heard your murmured vow,<br>
     When I whispered: "Go in peace."<br>
    "Go in peace, and sin no more,"<br>
    Did you not touch Mercy's shore,<br>
     Did not sin's wild tempest cease?<br>
 </P>
 <p style="color: #6A869E;"   Go! then: thou art good and pure!<br>
    If thou e'er shouldst fall, be sure,<br>
     Back to me thy footsteps trace!<br>
    In my heart for year and year,<br>
    Be thou far away or near,<br>
     I shall keep for thee a place. </p> 
	 <p style="color: #6A869E;"   Yes! I bless you -- near or far --<br>
    And my blessing, like a star,<br>
     Shall shine on you everywhere;<br>
    And in many a holy hour,<br>
    As the sunshine folds the flower,
     I will fold thy heart in prayer. </p>
